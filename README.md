# SILK WEB TOOLKIT

## About

A compile time web publishing toolkit created at [bheap ltd](http://www.bheap.co.uk/) and improved by the [community](http://www.silkyweb.org/community.html).

Silk allows you to build static websites out of re-usable building blocks without the use of server side languages, just use HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Sites built with Silk are clean from semantic pollution, no tag soup.

Improve the security of the web, use static wherever possible.  How many sites are dynamic beyond a contact form really ?  Why generate site content for every visit when you can do it once ?

## Status

Silk is already used in commercial projects at large multinationals (more news to follow).
